						<h3>Allen Glenn - Lead Vocals</h3>
					<p>I had always been involved in acting and music. From Kellogg's commercials in my childhood to finally getting a record deal after I moved to Minneapolis at age 21. I had a #2 song in Germany in 1995 which I recorded with Savannah Street Music and was a featured Artist on the &quot;Sunset Music Band&quot; CD, featuring Doc Severenson. I was fortunate enough to have also performed with: Brandy, BB King, Next, BeBe and CeCe Winans, Gladys Knight, Michael Bolton, Alexander O'Neil, Prince, and many others over the years, including The Good, the Bad and the Funky! After my Mother passed away from Cancer, I became interested in the medical field and earned a degree in Radiology while pursuing my love of music, which also keeps me very busy. Today, I find great joy in being able to play and gig with such a talented and fun group of guys like GBF!</p>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bio-layne-bender.png" alt="Layne Bender plays saxophone for the Good Bad and the Funky"></span></p>
						<h3>Layne Bender - Tenor Sax</h3>
					<p>As a kid in the late 60's and early 70's, my Dad loved Herb Albert and Al Hirt. My older brother introduced me to Bill Chase, Maynard Ferguson and Buddy Rich. We both decided we would play trumpet. Then came the terrible news we would have braces to correct our teeth which grew in every direction but straight. My brother chose drums and so did I. But wait... one drummer in the house was the limit. When my turn finally came I was lost. Then came Tower of Power. The third album featuring What is Hip and Soul Vaccination with Lenny Pickett's Tenor sax solo's and the horn section. That was it. Passion discovered ! <br>
					I was the weird band geek in school who loved jazz, soul and funk when Manilow and Kiss were the big deal. I went to all the Maynard Ferguson, Earth Wind and Fire, Tower of Power and Buddy Rich concerts I possibly could before I graduated but Tower of Power really grabbed me. A few years later I responded to an add in the City Pages for a sax player from a group of guys with a band called Heat Treatment. Mick Sterling was the singer, Mark Moran on keys, his brother Tim on drums and Jeff Fideler on guitar. Then we became &quot; Mick Sterling and the Stud Brothers&quot; <br>
					We found our calling at Bunkers on Sunday nights. History was made. I realized then with the right people, we could create a musical force to satisfy ourselves plus deliver a musical product that a live music fan could enjoy. GBF is our second offering in 30 years and this year marks our 18th year. Mark Moran and I talk often about our outlook for the band. Give a live music fan an experience to hear a 10 piece band do something different from what you might normally hear from a large band, make sure you can dance till you drop and most of all, love every minute of performing and be forever grateful to the fans and club owners who pay to see our show. I'm very proud of GBF, current and past members, club owners and our loyal fans. Without all of you, we would not have lasted this long. <br>
					Mom and Dad : Thank you for forcing me to have braces on my teeth. This worked out much better!</p>

I've also recorded with Prince protege Tony Lemans at The Record Plant in San Francisco. Locally I have been a member of Soulution, The Prophets of Soul, Stone Cold Blues and various artists that include guitarist Paul Holland, vocalist Ronn Easton and saxophonist Walter Chancellor. My motto is &quot;it's all about the groove&quot;.&nbsp; One of my favorite quotes is from Marcus Miller (one of my favorite bass players) who said &quot;it's what you don't play...that makes the groove real.&quot;</p>

			  <h3>Mark Moran - Keyboards</h3>
					<p>In 1987 I was sitting in my parents basement with my brother Tim, trying to come up with a name for a new 10-piece soul band we were putting together with Layne Bender and Jeff Fideler on a total whim. Something to please the guys in the band since there was no way the music public would get it at all. We wanted a BIG name, something based on the singer's name, Michael Jensen. Not much there until my brother thought about his middle name, Sterling, hmmm. We already wanted the &quot;and the&quot; part to be The Stud Brothers since stud was a catch phrase for cool waaaay back then. Mick Sterling and the Stud Brothers was born. We went from playing for free 6 Sunday's at Bunkers to almost having the fire marshall shut the place down with the huge crowds. That band is in the Mid-America Music Hall of Fame and you can read all about it in Mick's book. Now GBF's similar but I think closer to what we wanted all those years ago. Big and nasty trying to find a different spin on arrangements with great players and great guys from top to bottom. We're really on a roll right now. I hope you enjoy this. This is the best we can do!</p>
